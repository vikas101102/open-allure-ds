What number comes before 10?
One ; Only in the binary (base 2) numbering system.  Try again.
Nine ; Only in the decimal (base 10) numbering system.  Try again.
Fifteen ; Only in the hexadecimal (base 16) numbering system.  Try again.
It depends ;; Correct. The value of a 1 in the second place of a two digit number depends on the base.

A digit in the first place of a number counts multiples of 1.
A digit in the second place counts multiples of the base, n.
So what does 10 base n equal?
One ; Close. One what?
Ten times n ; No, suppose the base, n, was 2. Ten times n would be ten times 2 or twenty. Try again.
n ;; Correct. The 1 in one-zero represents one multipled by the base, n, and 1 times n is n.
One times n ;; Excellent.

What does 20 base n equal?
Two ; Close. Two what?
Twenty ; Only if the base, n, is 10, so you have two times ten.  What if the base, n, is 16?
Two times n ;; Correct. If the base were 16, you would have two times 16 or 32.
Twenty times n ; No, suppose the base, n, was 4. Twenty times n would be twenty times 4 or eighty.  Try again.
