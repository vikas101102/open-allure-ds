What color is the sky
overhead at midday
on a clear and cloudless day?

The sky is Orange ; Perhaps at sunset. What about midday? Try again.
The sky is Blue ;; Correct.  Now what causes a blue sky?
The sky is White ; Perhaps near the horizon or on a cloudy day. Try again.
The sky is Black ; Black is the correct answer for someone standing where there is no atmosphere. What about on the Earth?


Is the sky blue
due to

the color of sunlight ; Yes. Sunlight contains blue light and other colors of light. But what makes the sky appear blue overhead at midday?
the color of the atmosphere ;; Correct. The air around the Earth is not entirely transparent.
how our eyes see colors ; Yes. Seeing in color is required for the sky to appear blue. But what causes a blue sky?


What happens
when light passes through air?

Nothing. It just passes through. ; Yes, this lets us see long distances through clear air. But something must happen to cause blue light to come from the sky.
The air bends the light. ; Well, the light coming from the sun definitely goes in a different direction when it hits the atmosphere, but not by bending. Try again.
The light is partially absorbed. ;; Correct. The air absorbs and then radiates the blue light.


What word describes
what happens to the blue light in the sky?

scattering ;; Correct. Rayleigh scattering makes the sky blue because the light is first absorbed and then radiated in different directions.
reflecting ; Reflected light is not absorbed and so it arrives and departs at fixed angles. Try again.
refracting ; Refracted light is not absorbed but is bent so it travels at a different, fixed angle.  Try again.
