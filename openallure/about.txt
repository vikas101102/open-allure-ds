Open Allure is a dialog system.
It talks. You talk.
That makes a dialog.

How does it know what to say? ; Each answer has a scripted response.
Can I say anything? ;;
[input];;

The base system has limited capabilities
but is open to expansion
through the addition of
linked scripts.

How are scripts linked? ;;
[input];;

One kind of link takes you to a web page.
For example:

[http://www.google.com Google];; This should have opened a browser to Google if your configuration is correct.
[http://code.google.com/p/open-allure-ds/wiki/SeparateContentFileSyntax Link Syntax Documentation];; This should have opened a browser to a page describing the Open Allure link syntax if your configuration is correct.
Other kinds of links;;
[input];;

Another kind of link
allows one script
to lead to another.
We are in a script called about.txt now.
