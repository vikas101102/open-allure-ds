Welcome to Open Allure's documentation!
=======================================

Open Allure is a voice-and-vision enabled dialog system written in Python_.

Edit the openallure.cfg file to configure the location of the initial
question/answer/response sequence.

Cross-Platform Status
=====================

Open Allure aims to run on Windows, Linux and Mac. The Windows platform
currently tops the feature list with working voice and vision input and pretty
good text-to-speech output running Vista.  Linux has working vision input and
so-so text-to-speech output (eSpeak).  Mac has neither voice nor vision input
but has the best text-to-speech output (say).

Dependencies
============

Open Allure uses pyGame_ and BeautifulSoup_ and NLTK_ (Natural Language Toolkit).

Voice recognition depends on the operating system or other software. For Windows, dragonfly_
connects to the Windows Speech API. For Mac, dragonfly_ connects to `MacSpeech Dictate`_. For linux,
we're still looking to connect a voice recognition backend -- please pitch in!
