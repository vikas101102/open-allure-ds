# Key to the parts of an Open Allure rule:
#
#     [Section: type of rule]
#        The type of rule determines which block of code in chat.py
#        will be used to process the parsed string.  All the rules of 
#        a given type can be listed in a section.
# 
#     [[Sub-section: name of rule]]
#         Each rule should have a unique name.  This name can be 
#         posted to the log so it can be worked out which rule fired
#         and led to the observed behaviour of Open Allure.
#
#     example = 
#         (optional) 
#         NOTE: If left out, there must be a regular expression (below)
#         Example question from which Open Allure derives a regular expression.
#         Strings which must be matched are enclosed in brackets.
#         For instance,
#
#         example = "Who is alan [turing]?"
#
#         should be converted to the regular expression
#
#         re = '(.*)(turing)(.*)'
#
#         which would lead to matches on all sorts of inputs, including
#         "Tell me about Turing."
#         "What is the Turing Test?"
#         "Was Turing gay?"
#
#         This brings up the issue of rule ORDER.
#         More specific matches need to come first, so if you want
#         something special in response to
#         "What is the [Turing Test]?"
#         that rule must come BEFORE the response to
#         "Who is Alan [Turing]?"
#         or else the Turing Test rule will never fire.
#
#     re = 
#         (optional) 
#         NOTE: If an example (above) exists, this overrides it.
#         Regular expression used to match against input string
#         For instance,
#
#         re = '(.*)(turing|loebner)(.*)'
#
#         where the vertical bar indicates logical OR
#
#         Special symbols include:
#         . Any single character
#         ^	Start of String
#         $	End of string
#         \	Escape the next character; interpret it literally
#         n* Zero or more of 'n'
#         n+ One or more of 'n'
#         n? A possible 'n'
#
#     reply = 
#         Reply from Open Allure
#         Triple quoted strings allow for multi-line scripts here.
#
#         In other words, the reply can include an entire 
#         question sequence, not merely a direct answer.
#
#         Open Allure stands out from other chatbots with this capability.
#         Scripts allow Open Allure to take some of the initiative and
#         guide the conversation in a particular direction or offer alternatives.
#

# link rules are used in scripts to allow a match with an ad hoc input
# to cause a jump to a particular question tag

# text rules return some open allure script to continue the dialog
