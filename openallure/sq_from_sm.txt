# Title: Structural Quality of Software Architectures

So, you want to know something about the structural quality of an architecture.  Good.  There are two key criteria.  Do you know what they are?

No ; [ExplainAll] OK, let me help you with that first.
Yes ; [Reinforce] Good.  We can revise these now.
Not sure ; [ExplainAll] Well, let's look at the general idea first.

[ExplainAll]
The two criteria are coupling and cohesion.  These provide complementary indications of how 'good' the structure is, and are commonly used in architecture evaluation.  Can you now recall what they are and what they measure?

No ; [Reinforce] OK, we'll look at them now.
Yes ; [CheckMeasure] Excellent - let's check your understanding.

[Reinforce]
Let's deal with coupling first.  What is coupling?

The number of components in an architecture. ; Not really.  This might give an indication of size, but not coupling.
A measure of complexity. ; Coupling might contribute to complexity, but measuring complexity is pretty fraught, as it is so subjective.
A measure of the dependencies between components. ;; Yes that's right - it tells us how interlinked the parts of the architecture are.

OK, let's look at cohesion now.  What is meant by cohesion?

The minimum number of lines of code (LoC) required for the function. ; No that's not it - and in any case, the minumum number of lines will depend on the language you are using.
The degree to which the component performs a single function. ;; That's exactly it! Nice answer.
The depth of the inheritance tree. ; No, that measures a different aspect of structure, and comes from the Chidamber and Kemmerer (CK) suite of metrics.


[CheckMeasure]
What metric could we use to measure coupling?

The CBO metric. ;; Yes, that's a good measure to use here.  CBO, or Coupling Between Object Classes, counts the instances when methods declared in one class use methods or instance variables defined by the other class.  High levels of CBO suggest lots of dependencies, which can make maintenance really difficult.
The lines of code measure. ; No, that would give us a pretty raw measure of the size of a single component, but tells us nothing about coupling.
Weighted Methods per Class (WMC). ; While this is a useful measure, it only accounts for quality internal to a component, rather than between components.  Still, we should keep WMC down though, as high WMC values have been linked to high numbers of faults in code.


What about cohesion - how do we measure that?

By counting the Number of Children of a component. ; This is another of the CK metrics, but accounts more for structural linking than cohesion.
Using counts of methods and variables. ;; Yes that's it.  This is not easy though, and is generally more subjective than the measurement of coupling.


Hopefully now you have an initial grasp of coupling and cohesion. A lot more information about these and related aspects of architectural quality can be found here.
