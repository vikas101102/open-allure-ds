# Everything you type into an Open Allure script
# is something the computer might say
# (depending on which answers are selected).
#
# The script format is a series of questions
# with suggested answers
# and (optional) responses to those answers:
#
#    Question 1
#    Answer <separator> Response
#
#    Question 2
#    Answer <separator> Response
#
#    ...
#
# The <separator> includes at least one semi-colon
# which serves to
# 1) separate an answer from the response to that answer
# 2) determine the "correct" answer(s)
# 3) tell where to find the question that comes next after that answer
#
# Questions and Answers are shown and spoken.
# The optional Responses are just spoken.
#
# Here is a more complete format for one question:
#
#    # Comments (these are part of the script file, but are not seen or heard)
#
#    Question (or statement)
#    Answer 1 ;  Response 1 (one semi-colon  for "wrong"   answer -- stay    on this question)
#    Answer 2 ;; Response 2 (two semi-colons for "correct" answer -- proceed to next question)
#    ...
#    up to  6 Answer/Responses
#
#    <one or more blank lines between questions>
#
# Finally, to allow for input other than the suggested answers,
# you can add an input prompt:
#
#    [input];;
#
# FOR EXAMPLE:

How many people will you tell about this software?
Zero ; Really? How about people you don't like? You could use this to your advantage.
One ; Just one? Maybe you should make more friends.
Lots ;; Great. Tell everyone. The fate of the world depends on you. Now here is your question.
[input];;

# Your turn now. You can modify this file.
# When you are finished, save this file
# then open it in Open Allure
# with the command
#
#     open start.txt
