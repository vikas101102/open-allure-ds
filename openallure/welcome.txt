Your computer is reading a script.
You can write your own script to make computers say whatever you like.

[info]
Open Allure aims to do for instructions what Wikipedia has done for references.

Using scripts collaboratively created on wiki pages,
Open Allure uses text-to-speech to talk through procedures.

When interaction is required, the script can offer choices and pause.

Would you like to learn to write a script?

Yes ;[learn]
No ;;  OK. 

[navigate]
Navigating in Open Allure can be a simple matter of following the script.

Press 1 for the first choice
if you are offered several choices.
Press 2 for the second choice
and so on.

Alternatively, you can point to the choice you want 
and click on it.

You may need to open different scripts, 
but this is pretty easy.
Use the command 
"open" 
followed by the name or location of the script.

For example, you could open this script with
"open welcome.txt"
or,
since all local script files end in .txt,
you can leave off the .txt and just enter
"open welcome"

Continue ...;;
[input];

If the script you want is on the internet,
copy the address to your computer clipboard
with Control + C or Command + C (on a Mac),
then type "open", 
a space,
and press Control + V to paste it into Open Allure.
Finally, press Enter.

Continue ...;;
[input];

If you want to back up and have something repeated,
press the left arrow key.

[searching]
You have probably grown used to the idea
of typing a few words into Google
and having something relevant show up.
You can do Google searches from within Open Allure
by entering "search" followed by your search words.

But let's move on to searching within a script;;
[input];;

The Open Allure Project aims to deliver something even simpler than Google's searches.

You should eventually be able to just speak a few words
and have the system start speaking back 
using a relevant script
or some part of the script you are working with.

For now, 
you are limited to typing in your commands,
but earlier versions for Windows accepted voice inputs.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfKTk6rgWsA Check it out here on YouTube];;
Continue ...;;

There are four levels of command in Open Allure.
The top level commands provide core functionality
like "open" and "exit".
If you want to back up and have something repeated,
you can use the top level commands
"prior" or "go back"
but the left arrow key is easier.

Continue ...
[input];

The next level of commands are coded in the scripts,
so Open Allure can dynamically change the words and phrases it recognizes.

For example, a script could have a rule that says,
when the input is 
"Greetings"
reply with "Hello. How are you?"

[second level]
This second level could be developed 
to recognize key words in a question
and guide you appropriately.

For example, a rule could say, 
when the input includes the words 
"get around" or "find my way"
then jump to the section of the script on navigation.

Other parts of the input can be ignored,
so 
"how do i get around?"
would be recognized by the rule.
You can try this now, if you like.

Continue ...;
[input];

The third level of command is a subject heading search.

If the input doesn't match any other rules,
Open Allure checks to see if there is a match with a tag in the current script.

[tag back]
If you are brave, you can try using this command twice now.
First enter "navigate" to jump back to the start of this section.
Then enter "tag back" to jump back here.

Continue ...;;
[input];

The final level of command is just a full text search of the script, 
so if you want to find the first time
"Greetings"
is used, just enter Greetings
and Open Allure will jump there.

Continue at tag "keys" ...
[input];

[keys]
Open Allure scripts offer frequent opportunities for input.

The goal is for the interaction to be like a conversation.

If you see "[next]" on the screen,
you can start typing 
and interrupt the script.

If you don't see "[input]" and want to input some command,
press Control + I to force input.

You can scroll backward through a history of your inputs 
by pressing the up arrow key.
Scroll forward in your input history 
with the down arrow key.

Continue ...;
[input];

When you have interrupted a script 
but want to get back to it,
use the "return" command.

Try this now by pressing Control + I, then type "return" and Enter.;;
Continue ...;;

That's all for navigation at the moment.
It might be interesting for you to try the 
"show source"
command now (Mac only)
to see how this script looks.

Or just enter "learn" 
to learn about writing scripts.
