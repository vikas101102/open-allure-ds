OK. This is just a quick teaser presentation to encourage you to go watch an hour and a half long presentation on You Tube. The video came from Singularity University, this place for people who understand and develop exponentially advancing technologies. It is sponsored by Google.

The talk is given by Astro Teller, the Director of New Projects at Google. He spoke to the students at Singularity University about Innovation.

The video includes Astro talking. The students also ask him some questions.

He gives his whole talk using this one slide. It is a really great slide though, full of these little formulas relating to innovation.

For example, he starts off saying you need a story to have innovation. His formula reads, no story implies no innovation. He says, if you think you have a great idea, write the press release for it. Your innovation should be news worthy.

But it does not have to be entirely new. One great way to get innovation is to take ideas from one place and apply them in another place. Transplant ideas.

As a project develops from a prototype toward a real commercial product, there comes a point where you should just throw out all your code and start over. The rebuilding process gives you a chance to rethink and improve your design. You can be more innovative.

Then he makes a case for what he calls technology judo. Innovation is about counter-intuitive things. How can we perspective shift so things are no longer hard? This approach is far superior to the kind of brute force technology often used to tackle problems.

Again, the whole talk is worth watching, so here is an easy to remember shortcut. Astro at ess you. Enjoy!
