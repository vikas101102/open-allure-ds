Script for Chatterbox Challenge 2011

```
Thanks.
Hello ${name}.

Before you start asking questions,
please note this system was designed for making guided presentations of web pages
using text-to-speech
and may suggest responses from which to choose. 
These choices may open web pages in your browser.

Thus the interaction is not entirely within the standard chat interface.

In the event you are called on to make a choice and open a web page, 
please do not hesitate to use your mouse.

With that,
what is your first question?
[input];


[Are you]
The use of the word YOU in this question is ambiguous.
It could refer to a personification of this text-to-speech engine.
Or it could refer to the person writing the script for this text-to-speech engine.
Which do you mean?
The computer;;
Or the person;[Are you a person]

The computer is a communication device like your telephone.
You wouldn't normally ask a personal question of your telephone.

This technology does not have human characteristics 
such as feelings, sex or marital status.

What a computer system does have is computer characteristics
such as a development language and a software license. 

This software was written in Python or Java
(depending on whether you are running the desktop or mobile version)
and is distributed under an open source license.

Close your browser when you are finished
or switch back to enter your next question.
[input];

[Are you a person]
Speaking now as the author of this script,
not as the computer system delivering this message,
I can tell you about myself.

Are you actually interested in me as the person behind this script?
Yes;;
No;;;;

OK, my name is John Graves.
I live in Auckland, New Zealand.
And I am studying for a p h d in computer science.
To find out more, here is a link to
my Linked In profile

Close your browser when you are finished
or switch back to enter your next question.
[input];

Great. 
Thanks. 
It feels a little uncomfortable for me to give out personal details to strangers.
[input];


[Can I]
Determining whether you can, or not, requires a context for the question
or some significant assumptions. 

The author of this script does not want to make assumptions.

Remember that to assume, 
a 
s 
s 
u 
m 
e, 
makes an ass of you and me.

So let's turn the question around
and allow your subsequent input to clear this up.

If you could do what you ask, would it help you to give this system a positive evaluation?
Yes;;
No;;;

Ah, well then, of course you can!

Put yourself in my shoes as the author of this script.

I would like to give you a positive impression of this system.

I don't know about all the things you can and cannot do.
I don't even know who or what you are.
But I can direct you to resources describing what this system can and cannot do.

Does that interest you?
Yes;;
[input];

Great. 
I have a number of short videos and some documentation for you to look at.
Along with all the source code and a copy of this script.
Take a look at 
this web site
http://openallureds.org
[input];

Come back when you are finished to enter your next question.
[input];

[Can you]
This question has a hypothetical aspect to it.

Are you asking whether this system would be capable of delivering a particular response or type of response?
Yes;;
No;[Can you do other things]

The responses this system makes depend on the script it is currently playing.
Imagine asking your question of a book.
Doing what you ask would depend on the book.
The same thing is true with this system. 

If this were a script about the topic of interest, 
and the author had done a reasonable job,
the system should be able to deliver a helpful response
or direct you to where you could find what you are looking for.

In other words, hypothetically yes, but for this script, probably no.

The script you are interacting with right now is not general purpose.
It is solely for the Chatter box challenge
and is aimed at conveying the limited capabilities of this script, played on this system.

This system has the capability to play scripts fetched from the web,
so a different script could, in theory, anticipate your specific question
and play a more specific answer.
[input];

[Can you do other things]
This system is capable of playing a script 
and matching up parts of the input 
with the script author's best guess at an appropriate reply.

It is aimed at simply giving the script author a way to control the flow of a presentation of a topic
rather than the more difficult goal of holding a sustained conversation on any topic.

The system can help you look things up with a "search" command,
but this just passes your search on to Google.

You might try out this feature by entering
"search wiki"
later on.
[input];


[Describe]
Spoken language has great power to convey ideas.

This system can be used to verbally describe as many things as script authors choose to use it for.

This script is devoted to describing the capabilities of this system
which are limited, at any given time, to the contents of the script the system is playing.

This system is interesting because it makes it very easy to author scripts
(a script can be posted on a blog or on an ether pad).
The scripts can also link from one to another, 
just the way web pages link together.

So there you have it. 
The system has delivered a description.

It was probably not the description you asked for,
but it is the description this script's author wanted to give to you.
[input];


[Do you know]
This script does not contain information beyond some details of the workings of the system playing this script.

If you want to use this system to look things up,
the system has a search command
but all "search" does is pass your query along to Google.

This system allows the chat interaction to be a subject-specific guide 
into the many other resources available on the internet.

For example, suppose you want to find an answer to your question.
Answering questions is now the topic of discussion.

Here are a variety of other web sites you might visit
to get an answer to your question:
[http://www.wolframalpha.com/ Wolfram Alpha (for factual questions)];
[http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page Wiki How (for how to questions)];
[http://stackoverflow.com/ Stack Over Flow (for programming questions)];
[http://www.quora.com/ Quora (for more intellectual or business-related questions)];
[input];


[Do you]
This question imputes human qualities to this system.
But this system just plays scripts. Period.

The scripts are written text.
Just because the system plays a script interactively using text to speech 
doesn't make the script any more human than a book or a web page.

On the other hand, the author of this script is human
and consequently has a full range of beliefs,
likes and dislikes, opinions and emotions.

If I wanted to convey all those dimensions of myself,
I could write about them in a script. 

But, at the moment, what I want to convey is my hope that this technology will encourage a new genre of writing:
the writing of interactive dialog scripts.
[input];

[Have you]
Probably not (assuming the question is directed to the system, not the author of the system).

This system has only existed in this form since December 2010,
and this script is being authored in March 2011,
so the combination has not had much time to accomplish things as yet.

The author of this script has accomplished many things,
most notably creating the system which is playing this script.

The question is interesting for the implication that the system could have self knowledge
or, specifically, awareness of past events.

This system is limited to self reference (as illustrated by this statement). 
Any knowledge comes from the script author and is limited to what is written into the script.

The exciting prospect, however, is that lots of people might write a huge number of scripts,
just as millions have authored books
and thousands have collaborated on creating an encyclopedia.
[input];

[How can I]
It would be great if this system could answer a question of this type directly,
giving you useful advice and guidance.

For now, all this script can do is demonstrate a framework 
for the authoring and delivery of answers.

Take, for example, the question from a prior Chatter box challenge,
How can I make a chatter bot?

A useful answer to this question requires more than a glib reply.

We would like the reply to be a well constructed series of steps
including branches dealing with different circumstances.

The whole sequence might start out with a question such as:
What operating system do you have available for your chatter bot?
Mac;;
Windows;;
Linux;;
i OS;;
Android;;
Other;;

Depending on the answer, the steps might be very different.

With the current system, the one playing this script, 
the responses made by the system come from a script.

Scripts can be shared and improved in the same way Wikipedia articles are shared and improved.

So, while this script may not have answered your question,
the potential exists for scripts to be written and played by this system
which would answer your question.

Moreover, if the answer needed improvement, 
anyone could improve on it.

And, in this way, over time, if enough people contributed improvements,
the answers could become very useful.
[input];

[How are]
This question presumes an ability to sense the state of the world 
or the state of the system
which this system does not currently have.

This script playing system has a rudimentary capability to record and manage the state of the question answering interaction.

Specifically, it records the events of the interaction, 
noting which statements it makes and what inputs you make.

This enables simple navigation, such as going backward
through the history of the interaction.
The tracking also helps to avoid repeating the same answers out loud,
since people find repetition very annoying.

This data may seem boring,
but keep in mind that Google makes lots of money from simple navigation.

If you want to access sources of information where the current state of the world is presented,
consider these web sites:
[http://news.google.com/ Google News];
[http://www.weather.com/ Weather.com];
[http://twitter.com/ Twitter];
[input];

[How many]
Some questions of this type have been asked in prior years of the Chatterbox challenge 
and answers can now be obtained from other sources, as will be shown in a moment.

This system has a different objective. 
Counting up or looking up "how many" of something may be useful for some applications,
but engaging in a guided discussion of the resulting number in context could be downright educational.

To create that educational value, this system aims to catch domain specific questions
in relation to a presentation which gives more than just a factual response.

For example, if this script was concerned with anatomy or language,
and the question was "How many fingers does a human have?"
the script could respond with a commentary observing that the answer could be 8 or 10 
depending on whether you count thumbs as fingers.

This script has been designed to catch and discuss the various types of questions
asked in the Chatterbox challenge in prior years,
so it is fulfilling its domain specific task.

If what you want are general purpose answers, however,
they are available elsewhere.

Here are some prior questions with links to the answers now available from Wolfram Alpha or via Google:
[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=How+many+fingers+does+a+human+have%3F How many fingers does a human have?];
[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=How+many+is+1%2C000%2C000%3F How many is 1,000,000?];
[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=How+many+days+are+there+in+a+leap+year%3F+ How many days are there in a leap year?];
[http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEM75BS1VED_index_0.html How many stars are there?];
[input];

[How]
An explanation is required to answer "how"
rather than just a number or simple statement.

The explanation, in this case, relates to how a relatively simple system
might provide a way for text-to-speech output to be used more often.

Chat bot engines have been difficult to extend, 
due to some combination of obscure content syntax,
proprietary knowledge base or focus on parsing input
rather than collecting output.

This system is different in that it aims to make content creation 
as simple and collaborative as possible.
The syntax is mostly just plain text with very little markup.

Input parsing is done only for purposes of content navigation.
As a result, regular expression matching or an
even simpler type of 
matching by example 
can be used to anticipate questions on a particular topic,
much the way an index does at the back of a book.

It is more of a presentation tool than a traditional chat bot,
but it does talk and take questions.

With a collection of scripts like this one linked together on the internet,
this type of system could be how people begin explaining things to one another.
[input];

[If you]
Answering an arbitrary hypothetical question is beyond the capabilities of this script playing system.

Spotting one, yes. 
Answering a specific, anticipated hypothetical, yes.
Producing a response to a random hypothetical, no.

But the author of this script is certainly capable of entertaining hypothetical questions.

For example, If all the world were paper and all the water ink,
If all the trees were bread and cheese,
What would I have to drink? I'd say
the answer would have to be milk.
[input];

[Is it]
Trying to get truth statements out of a system which plays scripts
will only be as successful as the script authors are at anticipating the questions
and providing the answers.

This script, played on this system, has not anticipated your specific question, 
but that does not rule out the possibility of some other script delivering a direct answer,
most likely in the context of some domain of knowledge.

It seems reasonable, and maybe fun, to imagine a lot of authors
writing a lot of scripts.  

After all, a lot of contributors and editors worked together to create an encyclopedia.

The trick is to make it really easy to collaboratively write scripts.
That's what this system is all about.
[input];

[Is]
This answer is here to catch the question from a prior year "Is snow cold?"
and others like it that may come along.

The answer, as with so many things, depends on the context.
Relative to liquid nitrogen, at negative 196 degrees celcius, 
snow, at zero degrees, is hot.

This system is based on the idea that chat bot scripts can create the context for questions.

Start with some kind of presentation. Then ask for questions related to that presentation.

If an off-topic question comes up, refer it to other scripts 
(which might be easy to locate with a search engine if all the other scripts were just text 
sitting out there waiting 
on the internet).

You get the idea. 
[input];

[May I]
This system lacks the ability to determine what you can do.

You will probably have to try for yourself to find out.

Meanwhile, consider this:
you have a remarkable new power at your fingertips.

By creating a script like this one,
and by placing it on the internet,
you have the ability to "speak" 
asynchronously,
to anyone, anywhere in the world
who has this system installed on their computer or mobile phone.
For free. Indefinitely, from the moment you post your script.
[input];

[My (blank) is]
Thank you for sharing, but this system makes no effort to track random bits of information you enter.

It can, however, ask for and then use specific bits of information.

For example, at the start you replied that your name was ${name}.

To get this system to make such substitutions,
the author of the script puts a variable name
into the fixed content of the script.  For example, "name"
preceeded by a dollar sign.

Then, at the end of the script, the author writes an appropriate question
to elicit the value for that variable. For the name, the question was
"what is your name?"

The questions that need to be asked by the script to fill in the variables
are asked as the script is first loaded.

That does not mean ALL the fill in the blank questions need to be asked up front, 
however,
since scripts can be broken up into linked pieces 
and new variables can be introduced by the newly loaded pieces.

Meanwhile, the dictionary of "known" variable values persists 
throughout the session, so blanks do not need to be filled twice.
[input];

[Name (x)]
This kind of trivia question leads to trivial chat bot conversation.

There may be value in challenging the general knowledge of the A I,
so the answer may be something Wolfram Alpha can look up for you 
(examples coming in a moment),
but dishing up factual responses, 
particularly of items that happen to fall into a given category,
leads to a conversational dead end.

This system aims for a different goal: 
the creation of lots of domain specific scripts which have interesting things to say.
Scripts with the length and depth you find in a topical book.

Questions can then be anticipated or accumulated in the context of that script.
Like Google searches, the point of the questions will be navigational, 
helping to find the place in the 
script content 
where the topic of interest is discussed.

Now let's see what Wolfram Alpha does with a variety of "name that" 
questions.
At the time this script was written, only the first of these three "worked" 
in the sense of providing the expected answer.
[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=name+a+us+president Name a US President];
[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=name+something+you+would+find+on+a+beach Name something you would find on a beach];
[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=name+the+colors+of+the+rainbow Name the colors of the rainbow];
[input];

[I like]
When looked at from the perspective of one-way versus two-way communication,
interaction with a script playing system is fundamentally one-way,
from creators of a script to users of the system.

The users get to interact, but the limits of that interaction are set by the system.

In other words, whatever you like or dislike, 
or want or need,
this system doesn't care and won't remember.

It can be scripted to remember certain things, but these are pre-defined bits
that the author of the script deems useful in the context of the specific interaction.

For example, you replied at the start of this interaction that your name is ${name}.

Nevertheless, a script playing system can still be a tremendously useful resource.  
Think of the libraries of the world, which also ignore your personal likes and dislikes.

This system attacks the one-way problem at a "meta" level.
Make everyone a script creator (or editor).

If you think what you like is significant and important, 
write a script explaining why.  
Or modify someone else's script to "improve" their explanation.

It comes down to this: do you want to go to the movie that the paid reviewer likes? or
the one that lots of other people like? or both? This system 
aims to give people a voice, so we can choose.
[input];

[Of what]
Natural Language Processing with Python, a book by 
Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper, includes a corpus called Word Net
which they describe as follows:

Word Net is a semantically oriented dictionary of English, 
similar to a traditional thesaurus 
but with a richer structure. 
NLTK includes the English Word Net, 
with 155,287 words and 117,659 synonym sets. (page 67)

Word Net allows for relational queries:
hypernym - what is a more abstract word (vehicle for car),
hyponym - what is a more specific word (hatchback for car),
meronym - what are the parts or substance (branch for tree) and
holonym - what is this part of (forest for tree).

This type of question could be parsed and passed into such a query,
but there is no clear direction for the dialog beyond that answer.

A Google search on key words (rather than a fully formed question)
is adequate to locate content which provides both an answer 
and a context for questions of this type.

This system supports such searching with a "search" command.

Below are results from searches on the first word from similar questions from prior years.
These answers are very informative and offer numerous opportunities to pursue further inquiry. 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid Madrid is the capital of what country?];
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk Milk comes from what animal?];
[input];

[What do you think]
The question implies this script has thoughts,
which it does not.
So a slight adjustment of perspective is needed.

This script contains thoughts. Those thoughts formed in the author's mind
and have been expressed in this script. 
This script is too short to express all the author's thoughts.

This system is likely to be able to deliver a direct answer to the question
in the context of a different script, however.
Someone, somewhere, has probably expressed their thoughts 
in writing
about this question.

If people began to work together writing and editing scripts,
they way they have been writing and editing pages of an encyclopedia,
then a whole class of "what do we think" questions could have searchable answers.

That's the idea behind this system, anyway.
[input];

[What do you]
You who? This script or the author of this script? The question is not clear.

This script only contains a small, very selective subset of one author's views,
interests and activities. If you want to find out more about this one author 
in relation to some arbitrary topic,
you will have to talk to the author. 

If the question is addressed to the system, 
consider a different perspective.
Instead of aiming to communicate WITH this chat bot,
this system aims to communicate THROUGH the chat bot.

So a script only contains content the authors want to put into it.

What makes this system interesting is the collaborative editing
made possible by placing linked scripts on the internet.

You can find this script 
[http://openallureds.org by following this link];
[input];

[What is the]
When someone encounters a search engine for the first time,
they may mistake the search box for a place to enter a natural language query.

But the extra words "what is the" 
get in the way of the key words that follow.

This system treats chat inputs more like a search engine
than like a natural language processor. 
It attempts to match inputs with pre-defined templates.

This script only matches on part of the input,
in this case the words "what is the,"
ignoring the rest.

The rest of the question, of course, 
is normally the most important part.

A different script could match on that part,
leading to a scripted exploration of that topic.

This script does not contain a library of topics,
but, since the script comes into the system from the internet,
the idea is that the internet could hold a library of scripts.

A search engine could be used to find scripts containing the key words of a query 
and this system could play those scripts.

With this approach, the range of topics the system can "discuss" in a meaningful, 
in-depth manner is not constrained by the internal capabilities of the chat bot.

Have you got a better idea? Then add it here at
[http://www.allourideas.org/chatbot All Our Ideas];
[input];

[What is your]
#[What is your] favorite color?
It may make sense to ask a question of this type in a dialog with a person,
but this system is not a person
and does not pretend to be, even though it talks.

Speech and writing are ways of communicating between people.
This system is just technology, no different from a book or telephone.

The author of this script is a person, but that is the limit of the human-ness.
So, when you ask a "what is your" 
type question,
the possessive "your" 
must reach all the way back to the author to be meaningful.

Since the author is not synchronously engaged with the system,
the only answers you should expect to receive are the ones the author anticipated.

In this case, the only part of the question that was anticipated was the 
"what is your"
part.

A different script could anticipate the other part,
but there would need to be some domain in which such anticipation made sense.
[input];

[What is]
Questions starting 
with "what is" 
have been very popular in the Chatterbox challenge in the past.

The last "how" 
question, requiring an explanation rather than an answer, was in 2010.
It was "How does your brain work?"

This system aims to deliver longer, more coherent presentations 
rather than responses to random factual questions.

Obviously, facts may appear in these presentations, 
and this system aims to make it easy to locate those facts
which the script's authors see fit to mention
using key word rather than natural language inputs.

For example, a fact about a prior question was just mentioned.
To return to that point in the dialog, just enter 
"brain"
at the input prompt.
[input];

[What]
The word "what" 
has the vexing property of being an interrogative, a relative pronoun and an adverb.

You get an interrogative from "what is snow"
but a relative pronoun from "what is tossed up falls down"
and an adverb from "what a pity."

So this system is going to stop with this commentary on that one word 
and try to look smart.

For the purposes of navigating through a large collection of text content,
we don't really want to use "what"
anyway. 

Think of the index or table of contents of a book.
The approach of using key words and phrases works there, 
so the same approach should also work here.
[input];


[When]
A sense of time, a knowledge of history, an ability to weigh hypotheticals
any of which may be called upon by the word "when"
are all beyond the capabilities of this script on this system.

To answer "when is lunch today?" requires knowing when lunch is normally served
and how the current time relates to that time. 
(Although perhaps the glib answer is "now" 
since it is now lunchtime somewhere on the planet.)

To answer "when was the civil war in the united states?" draws on historical facts.
(Although, again, a glib answer which is "true" but useless is
"The civil war happened before the end of the civil war.")

And to answer "when I am old and gray, will you still love me?" takes imagination.
(With the glib answer being, of course, "I do not love you now!")

This system can deliver content when it is accessed,
which is a very useful feature.  So, for all the things this system cannot do,
it does have the ability to function asynchronously
when needed.
[input];


[Where]
Locating things involves having a sense of space,
which, of course, is well beyond the capabilities of a system which has "senses"
of keyboard and mouse.

This system was created in Auckland, New Zealand, 
but since it consists entirely of downloaded software and data
it runs (or exists) on the system you are using to interact with it.

If you want to locate a place, 
Google Earth has been doing some amazing things with mapping.
[http://maps.google.com/ Follow this link];
[input];


[Which]
It is challenging enough to sort out what to do with one thing in a question
and a "which" 
question asks to weigh 
and compare multiple things.

This script will only go so far as to say which questions are harder.
(I'll say that again, in case you missed it: 
"which" 
questions are harder.)
[input];


[Who]
Identifying people, naming particular (for example, favorite) people 
and assigning roles are some of the functions
of a "who" 
question.

One "who" 
question of the third type is of particular interest.
Consider "Who created the world wide web?"

The DESIGN for the system originated with Tim Berners-Lee
but the creation, the actual building of it, involved people around the globe.

That's a good model for creating lots of interactive dialog scripts.
A design which opens up the creative process to anyone
generates network effects.

The more people who get involved,
the more value is created for everyone involved.

If other chat bots in the 2011 Chatter box challenge share this perspective,
that's great. 
For those who don't, imagine trying to design 
AND BUILD 
the world wide web on your own.
[input];


[Why]
Questions requiring explanations cry out for presentation and discussion, 
not just answers.

Consider the question from 2010: "Why are robots better than humans?"

You really want a system capable of taking such a question as a point of departure
for a discussion that touches on both the pros and cons of robots.

A simple "why"
question, 
taken in isolation, 
does not usually provide enough context for a simple answer.
For example, "Why are robots better than humans at playing chess?"
comes closer to a question with a simple answer 
because the question is framed in the context of chess.

If the context is left out, the question might as well be "Why are robots better?"

And, from there, it is not much of a jump to just "robots"
since, implicitly, 
an explanation of why robots are better could also address why they are not.

All of which goes to the point of the approach taken by this system.
Instead of aiming to parse natural language input and make conversation,
this system aims to use text input for navigation.  
The way Google uses text input,
except within the scope of a script about a specific topic.

Once all the questions have been asked,
experiment with the "contents"
command to get an overview of all the sections of this script.
Each section deals with a different type of question.

You will be able to click into any of the sections of interest.
Again, this just involves using text for navigational purposes.

It will generally take longer explanations to answer "why" 
questions, 
but actually asking "why"
may complicate the task of finding those explanations.
[input];


[Will]
Having the ability to make predictions about the future 
may be one of the distinguishing features of "intelligence."

This system can capture the expectations of script authors,
but those expectations (within this script, at the time of writing this script)
do not go far beyond a set of questions which require responses.

Yet consider, for a moment, our other systems of knowledge transfer.
Books are written in anticipation of readers.
Television shows are produced in anticipation of viewers.

Person to person conversation is normally generated on demand,
but person to computer conversation 
could be developed in a way that anticipates users.

As with books and television shows, 
selection of the subject matter of the interactive script 
would be a critical part of the interaction.

The chat bot would not be one size fits all,
making conversation on any topic.
Rather it would be a system for delivering selected content,
just as books and television sets deliver selected content.

Will such a system be developed? It will, 
if enough people see value in the idea.
This system presents a working prototype.
If you would like to get involved in helping the idea to succeed,
join 
[http://bit.ly/openalluregg the Google Group for the project.];
[input];


[Would]
Toying with the hypothetical world of "would"
can turn thinking into worrying.

This script on this system aims to avoid both thinking 
(and worrying) 
in favor of speculating about ideas which "could"
be more useful.

Distributing knowledge about what happens (or would happen) when 
preventive medicine is practiced
could extend and enhance life.

Distributing knowledge of what happens when
money is saved and invested
could improve the economy.

Distributing knowledge, generally,
could help people make better decisions,
build better products and live happier lives.

This system aims to leverage linnked, interactive, text-to-speech scripts
to distribute knowledge.

[Would not]
Where "would"
suggests a positive, "would not" 
suggests a negative,
and therein lies the nexus of such hypothetical choices. 

The answer could go either way, depending on the hypothetical circumstances.

Things get even more complicated when a hypothetical past is considered,
as in "If I had asked a different question, would you have answered the same?"

A script author would need to anticipate such specific questions
for this system to respond more specifically.
[input];

[I am]
You should probably mark this question as a zero for now. 

This system aims to capture pre-determined information,
such as your name (which you said was ${name})
rather than capture information as it is volunteered.

[I (blank) in]
Not to be rude, ${name}, but this fact is not being tracked by this script on this system.
