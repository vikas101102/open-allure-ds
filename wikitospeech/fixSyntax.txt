When Open Allure has problems reading a script,
the problem may be due to the language setting.

You can change your language setting with 
the configure command (Mac OSX) 
or by modifying the openallure.cfg configuration file
which is a plain text file.  
Otherwise,

Modify the script;;
Check vocabulary;[vocabulary]

If the script has an error, 
you will need to fix it 
by editing the script 
or a copy of the script.
How you do this depends on whether

the script is a local text file;[local]
or is on the internet.;;

To edit a script on the internet,
open the script in your web browser.
You should then be able to edit in place
(on a wiki or Etherpad)
or at least copy the script 
(from a blog post, for example).

If you can't edit in place, 
use copy and paste 
to get a copy into your text editor 
and save it as a local text file.

[local]
Working with a local text file
requires saving the file as plain text.
Not as Rich Text Format .rtf 
or as a word processing document,
but just plain text, 
with the extension .txt

It is helpful to know 
how an Open Allure script 
is supposed to be laid out.
You can find some documentation and examples

[http://code.google.com/p/open-allure-ds/wiki/SeparateContentFileSyntax here];;
or check the vocabulary;;

[vocabulary]
Open Allure works using a set of rules 
or vocabulary
in a text file called responses.cfg 
(or similar depending on the language).

You can get a list of the rules 
with the vocabulary command (Mac OSX).
