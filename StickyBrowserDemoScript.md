```
[stickyBrowser=True]
With sticky browser turned on (or true), 
going to a website will cause Open Allure to be quiet.
For example, follow this link
Google ...
http://www.google.com

Open Allure didn't say anything while you were on the Google home page.

[stickyBrowser=False]
Until it gains focus again,
Open Allure stops talking.
But with sticky browser off (or set to false),
this same link will be given a voice over.
Google ...
http://www.google.com

See? Now we are talking about the Google home page.

We can say all we like about this website.

Open Allure won't stop talking until it needs an answer,
runs into an input prompt
or runs out of script.
