Eric A. Meyer has created a full screen, 
in-browser, 
presentation tool 
called S5
for Simple Standards-based Slide Show System.
Let's 
[file:///Users/johngraves/Downloads/s5-11/xoxo-s5-demo.html take a look.];;

...


We can use Open Allure to talk about each slide.
[file:///Users/johngraves/Downloads/s5-11/xoxo-s5-demo.html#slide2 next];;

...

And advance slides automatically.
[file:///Users/johngraves/Downloads/s5-11/xoxo-s5-demo.html#slide3 next];;

...

We're now on slide 3.
But that doesn't stop us from going back to slide 2.

Pretty neat, eh?
