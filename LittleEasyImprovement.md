# Little Easy Improvements #

Here's a list of various improvements that we'd like to make to Open Allure. Some are trivial, some are a bit more substantial, but all are easy enough to be a quick project for people who want to get involved with Open Allure development. If you don't feel like coding in Python you can always help with Open Allure script creation, translating existing scripts or documentation, or just helping people who could benefit from Open Allure to find out about it (adult literacy groups, under-served inner city schools, developing countries, etc.).

  * Add a scoring system to pyPong or pyGhost
  * Open Allure: Add a toggle and configuration setting to show/hide the three webcam feedback thumbnails across the bottom of the screen
  * Open Allure: Add multiple speaker avatar functionality along with TTS options to change the voice used between speakers
  * Create pyAutoharp by linking the webcam-based inputs to chord selection/note selection with MIDI output
  * Check in with the [Open Allure Google Group](http://bit.ly/openalluregg) to see if someone needs help or has questions
